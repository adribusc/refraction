Refraction is a small library that act as a central point in our application, but it cannot be used alone, we must have a series of other libraries to add functionality to our software.
For example, Refraction is suitable to be used with a mechanism that automatically reproduce a series of events for testing or automation purpose, but there is not this functionality in the core library. We need another library to do this.
